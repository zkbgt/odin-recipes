    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kiwis love their cheese scones. I was hooked instantly and found <a href="https://moorlandseater.com/very-cheesy-cheese-scones/">this fab recipe</a> which is dangerously delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>450 g self raising flour plus extra for rolling</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>pinch salt</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>250 g grated cheese (e.g. mature Cheddar) you can substitute some of the Cheddar with Parmesan, gruyere etc.</li>
        <li>250 ml yogurt (or milk or buttermilk or any of these diluted with water) plus extra for brushing the tops of the scones</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and lightly grease or line a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour, baking powder & salt mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir 225g of the cheese into the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in enough yogurt (or your chosen liquid) to the dry ingredients to start forming a soft but not wet dough. <em>Note: different flours absorb different amounts of liquid so you may not need all of the 250ml OR you may need a little extra.</em></li>
        <li>Briefly and lightly knead the dough on a floured surface to bring together then roll out to approximately 2-3 cm thickness. Cut out scones, re-rolling the scraps to make more. A 6 - 7cm cutter should make 12 scones. Place the cut out scones on the greased baking tray.</li>
        <li>FBrush a little yogurt or your chosen liquid over the tops of the scones then sprinkle with the remaining 25g of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Place in the pre-heated oven and bake until risen and golden (13 - 18 min).</li>
        <li>Transfer to a wire rack to cool a little.</li>
        <li>Serve slightly warm, split and spread with butter. <em>Tip: pulling the scone apart rather than cutting will keep the interior fluffy.</em></li>
        <li>If not using straight away, cool completely before storing in an airtight container. Use within 2 days or freeze. Reheat in a microwave or low oven.</li>
    </ol>

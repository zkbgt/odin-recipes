    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make this at night after dinner so when it comes out of the oven I can have it warm with ice cream. So good! When its cooled I have it with yoghurt and fruit, or by itself as a snack. Original recipe over at <a href="https://www.cookedandloved.com/recipes/paleo-granola-muesli/">Cooked & Loved</a>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups mixed almonds, hazelnuts, macadamia and brazil nuts (I usually use 1 cup almonds 1 cup macadamia 1 cup brazil nuts)</li>
        <li>⅔ cup dried fruit (plums, dried cherries, cranberries, apricots, figs or dates)</li>
        <li>½ cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)</li>
        <li>⅔ cup desiccated coconut, unsweetened</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut flakes (if you have them)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp honey (rice malt syrup, maple syrup or coconut syrup can also be used)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Optional but very nice: zest of 1 orange</li>
        <li>Dollop of coconut oil or ghee</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp chia seeds (I just add this to the servings)</li>
        <li>You will need a food processor or some other way to break the nuts into smaller crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 165°C (330°F).</li>
        <li>Add two and a half cups of whole nuts (reserve the rest as whole nuts) to a food processor. Process the mixture into medium size crumbs, some of it will turn into finer flour/meal like consistency but that's what we want - a variety of shapes and sizes. Transfer to a large bowl. (I add the dried fruit at the very end once the mix is cooled.)</li>
        <li>Add the remaining whole nuts and the rest of ingredients, excluding chia seeds. Mix well and use a wooden spoon or a spatula to break down the clumps which will form when coconut oil and honey come into contact with dry ingredients. It's ok if some of them remain unbroken.</li>
        <li>Grease a large baking tray with some coconut oil or ghee and line it with baking paper, making sure the sides are covered. Spoon the mix into the tray and flatten with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in three stages. First bake for about 12 minutes and then stir the mix as the top would have browned by now. Then bake for 8-10 minutes and stir again. Finally bake for the last 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove and let it cool completely. The mixture should have turned crispy and dark golden brown. (Take it off the baking paper before it cools completely as it will stick.)</li>
        <li>Finally add chia seeds and transfer to an air-tight container. You can leave it out of the fridge for a few days but it will keep longer, for up to two weeks, if you refrigerate it. (It doesn't last more than a few days!)</li>
    </ol>
